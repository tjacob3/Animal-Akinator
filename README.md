# Animal-Akinator a program called “Akinator” where instead of you finding celebrities, you find animals. This would be safe in the internet for students to learn and there is no danger to learn about animals. The idea for this project would be that the program would ask you questions that would describe the animal, and whether you click yes or no it would change questions based off of the answers that you clicked and try to get to the animal as close as possible. The people that would use it would be zoologists and wildlife biologists who want to study animals that are both in the wild and in captivity. Maybe they could use it to see how animals interact with their ecosystem and study their behavior.
